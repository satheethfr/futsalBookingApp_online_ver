# Project-Wide Design & UI Rules

- Always adhere to the project's established design system.
- Use colors, fonts, and spacing tokens from the main theme files.
- Ensure all new components are responsive and match the visual style of existing components like [example: src/components/Header.tsx] or [example: src/components/Card.tsx].
- All interactive elements must have clear `hover`, `focus`, and `active` states.
- Maintain a consistent design language across all pages. Do not introduce new, contradictory styles.
